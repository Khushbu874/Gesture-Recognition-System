#Gesture-Recognition-System

This project implements a gesture recognition system using Python. It captures hand, face, and shoulder landmarks using MediaPipe Holistic, extracts features, and trains a machine learning model (e.g., RandomForest or TensorFlow) for real-time gesture classification. 

Features:
- Real-time landmark detection via webcam
- Feature extraction from hand, face, and pose landmarks
- Data collection and labeling system
- Model training and evaluation scripts
- TFLite model export for Android deployment

Future scope:
- Integration with 3D avatars
- Real-time feedback or speech output
- Expansion to multi-user or multi-gesture datasets

This is part of the SilentTalk project."
